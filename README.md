# Hack4Space2021
## In this project, we aim to predict locations on Mars that quickly disperse air particles, as would be necessary in the case of terraforming Mars into a habitable planet.

Our team has compiled data from the Mars Climate Sounder[MCS] on Particle Density, H20_Ice, and H20_Vapor present in the atmosphere of Mars.
Using the orbital nature of the data retrieved from the MCS, we can predict larger wind movements across the surface of Mars.  Consider a
single pass of data collection across Mars, the result is a plotted line of higher and lower particle density areas.  If those high density
areas are still present when the MCS passes again, we can predict slower wind movement.  If the area no longer reports high density, we can
predict faster wind movements.

This data can be used as reference for future Mars colonization efforts.  Here on Earth, we know the direction of the winds affects how our
atmosphere disperses and captures greenhouse gasses.  Additionally, wind direction has been linked to impoverished areas, as smog from cities
lowers property value, causing long term harm to communities.

This presents two practical use cases for this data: creating better designs for Martian colonies and finding locations that could be best
suited to spread greenhouse gasses, with the intended effect of terraforming mars through changing its atmosphere.
